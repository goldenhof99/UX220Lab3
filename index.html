        <h2> Gladiator </h2>
        <p>Gladiator is my last favourite movie I saw and it is my current favourite movie. It is my favourite movie because of Russell Crowe's performance as Maximus. It is a story about a general turned Gladiator who fights for the freedom of Rome in the colosseum.
        What made me enjoy the movie so much was his pursuit of liberty and strong honour code. The overall action and deep routed family values in the movie also add so much to the overall cinema. </p>
        <p> Additonally, I love the movies score. I think it was one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. It had a great balance between high intensity action songs and beautiful, peaceful songs. Lastly, I thought the cinematography was amazing. The movie was shot very well. It
        truly depicted the barbaric time frame that Rome was back then. Since I have watched the movie I have probably rewatched it 3-4 times, truly my favourite and I do not see that changing anytime soon.
